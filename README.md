# Popclip-mail

A [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) extension for mail. if mail address is selected, selected text will fill mail address, otherwise selected text goes into body.

Based on the original copy of [generic-mail extension](https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions/tree/master/source/Email), ~~but failed to compile to working extension. Issue submitted [#1049](https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions/issues/1049).~~
